## üí° **Advanced SQL Techniques Demonstrated**

### **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
```sql
WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT customer_id, 
           AVG(usage) as avg_usage,
           SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
    FROM transactions 
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
customer_segments AS (
    SELECT *,
           CASE WHEN total_revenue > 1000 THEN 'High Value'
                ELSE 'Standard' END as segment
    FROM customer_metrics
)
SELECT segment, COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customer_segments
GROUP BY segment;
```

### **Window Functions for Time Series**
```sql
SELECT month,
       revenue,
       LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month,
       (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
       LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 as growth_rate
FROM monthly_revenue;
```

### **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring**
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       CASE WHEN days_inactive > 14 THEN 3 ELSE 0 END +
       CASE WHEN avg_usage < 10 THEN 2 ELSE 0 END +
       CASE WHEN support_tickets > 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as risk_score
FROM customer_activity;
```

## üß† **Analytical Insights & Design Decisions**

### **Data Generation Strategy**
> *"Creating realistic test data is crucial for SQL development. The data needs to have the right patterns and edge cases to test query logic properly."*

- **Beta Distribution**: Used for churn probability to create realistic right-skewed patterns
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Incorporated cyclical business trends in revenue data
- **Edge Cases**: Included inactive customers and varying usage patterns

### **Query Optimization Techniques**
> *"CTEs make complex queries maintainable and testable - essential for production BI systems."*

- **Modular Design**: Breaking complex logic into readable, testable components
- **Index-Friendly Patterns**: Query structures that work well with database indexes
- **NULL Handling**: Proper edge case management prevents dashboard errors

### **Business Metric Selection**
> *"Business context drives metric selection, not just technical capability."*

- **ARPU Calculations**: Average Revenue Per User for subscription business models
- **Cohort Analysis**: Customer lifecycle stage classification for targeted strategies
- **Risk Scoring**: Multi-dimensional behavioral analysis for proactive intervention
