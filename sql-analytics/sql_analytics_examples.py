SQL Analytics Examples for BI Dashboard Development
Demonstrates SQL skills relevant to data warehouse optimization and business intelligence

These examples show SQL queries for typical BI and finance dashboard tasks,
based on real-world analytics scenarios and best practices.

Note to self: Writing these queries taught me that good BI SQL isn't just about
getting the right data - it's about structuring queries for performance and
maintainability in production environments.
